# rvasm: A Python-Based RISC-V Assembler
**rvasm** aims to provide a simple and easy-to-use RISC-V assembler. Please consider that this project is still a work-in-progress - more updates coming soon!

## Getting started
You can install **rvasm** using `pip`, as follows:

> `pip install rvasm`

The command-line tool can be used to assemble an RV32I text file, as demonstrated below:
> `rvasm my_file.asm`

This will produce an output file `out.dat`, containing your assembled RV32I in hexadecimal.
